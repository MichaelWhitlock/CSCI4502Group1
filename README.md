### Project Description: 

Instacart is an online grocery delivery service. Our group’s motivation was to analyze patterns from Instacart orders. We wanted to determine if there are trends in the types or rate of products ordered depending on the time of day, week, and frequency of repurchases. 

Instacart gives a comprehensive list of orders and the contents, time of the order, and other information useful for the classification and prediction of future orders. Instacart already provides suggestions on other items a customer might also be interested in, likely combing the customers purchases and products which are popular on the site. We had a good number of general questions when starting this project, and formulated a number of others as we went through the data preprocessing stage.

### Questions Sought and Answers

One question or goal we were seeking to accomplish was if we could accurately predict a customers next purchase - either the most likely item that a customer will purchase in their next order or a collection of items we might suggest for them to purchase. 

Other questions we considered include: “Will a product be reordered based on the order it was placed into the shopping cart or what type of item it is?”; “How do orders vary across time (day of week and time of day)?”;  “Which items are most likely to be added order, based on the items already in the cart?”; “Based on purchase history, can we predict which new items a customer is most likely to purchase?”; and “Can we predict the length of time between orders?” 

We used a variety of methods in our attempts to answer these questions, including an initial exploratory analysis of the dataset, Rule Based Classification, A K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Support Vector Machine Model.  

### The Uses of this Knowledge

Ideally, our research could be used to help companies determine how best to target and advertise to customers, what products to stock in the highest quantity and possibly determine where the market appears to be untapped. 
One very interesting area for possible future research would be to compare these findings to similar measures for standard grocery stores (purchased from in person) to determine what, if any, differences are seen when grocery purchases are provided through a digital, delivery service. The potential application for this research are quite broad, and trends that are found could have implications or not only Instacart but also any other grocery and food delivery service, as well as any companies selling products through these services.
